# leaflet-challenge

For this challenge, I have developed a way to visualize USGS data for earthquakes recorded in a way that makes it easy to use for presentations.

I used TileLayer to load a map and markers for the earthquakes.

The marker information was imported from the USGS website and can be used on future information by updating the API. 

To make the data easier to digest to the end user, the markers were made to the size corresponding to earthquake magnitude.

Also there is a legend showing the depth and their corresponding colors for the markers. 

Each point has a tooltip with the Magnitude, the location and depth.
